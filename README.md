# GUI miniprojekt with pictures and recipies

On the occasion of Christmas approaching with brisk steps, I have made a mini program that shows pictures of Christmas cakes with accompanying recipes.

The program works by the user choosing between the tabs images and recipes. 
After selecting a tab, use the dropdown menu to select the image or recipe you want to display. 
When you have selected, press the show picture or show recipe button.
The selected one is now displayed on the right side of the box.
